            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p>Everyone loves cookies! And here in the Pacific Northwest, we just about everyone loves Salmon, too. One day we were taking a stroll down by the Pike's place market, and the idea occurred to us: Cookies + Salmon = IDEA! We quickly bought some fish from our favorite fish handlers, stopped by the local Trader Joes, and then went home and got to work. And we're not going to lie...getting this recipe right was some trial and error. I mean, really...have you ever tried putting salmon AND cookies in your mouth together at the same time?! We knew that traditional methods weren't going to be enough, and after nearly 200 failed recipes we were about ready to throw in the towel. And then, out of nowhere...SUCCESS! The Salmon Cookie was born!</p>
